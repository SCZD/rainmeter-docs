For a complete, line-by-line history of Rainmeter's source code changes since version <a href="#0.14">0.14</a>, see the project <a href="https://github.com/rainmeter/rainmeter/commits/master">commit history on GitHub</a></p>

<h2 id="4.1">Rainmeter 4.1</h2>

<p><b>April 21, 2017 - Revision 2787</b></p>
<ul>
<li><b>Added</b> String meter: Added new <a href="https://docs.rainmeter.net/manual-beta/meters/string/#FontWeight">FontWeight</a> option. This will effectively deprecate StringStyle.</li>
<li><b>Added</b> Shape meter: Added Path1 alternative of the Path shape. It will use a different form of the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/SVG/painting.html#FillProperties">SVG fill-rule</a> when the shape is filled with a color or gradient. This determines what parts of a shape with intersecting segments are "inside" the shape and what are "outside", for purposes of filling the shape with the defined color or gradient. See <a href="https://docs.rainmeter.net/manual-beta/meters/shape/#Path1">Path1 shape</a> for details.</li>
<li><b>Added</b> CoreTemp plugin: The author of both the <a href="http://www.alcpu.com/CoreTemp/">CoreTemp application</a> and Rainmeter plugin, Arthur Liberman, added CPU core-specific values to the data available in the plugin. See <a href="https://docs.rainmeter.net/manual-beta/plugins/coretemp/">CoreTemp plugin</a> for details.</li>
<li><b>Changed</b> Bitmap meter: Changed the allowable measure value when <a href="https://docs.rainmeter.net/manual-beta/meters/bitmap/#BitmapExtend">BitmapExtend=1</a> from a C-language int data type (2,147,483,647 maximum) to int64 (9,223,372,036,854,775,807 maximum).</li>
<li><b>Fixed</b> Bangs: Fixed an issue when the config parameter of a bang contained a leading or trailing slash.</li>
<li><b>Fixed</b> InputText plugin: Fixed a possible Rainmeter crash if an input box is open and the skin is deactivated.</li>
<li><b>Fixed</b> Shape meter: Fixed a possible Rainmeter crash if the starting point of a Path shape was invalid.</li>
<li><b>Fixed</b> Bitmap meter: Fixed an issue where BitmapExtend=1 would not increase the meters width and/or height, which would cause the meter to ignore DynamicWindowSize and draw outside its bounds and possibly truncate outside the skin window.</li>
<li><b>Fixed</b> Bitmap meter: Fixed an issue where the <a href="https://docs.rainmeter.net/manual-beta/meters/general-options/#Padding">Padding</a> height values on the meter would be ignored in some situations.</li>
<li><b>Fixed</b> InlineSetting: Corrected an issue where Rainmeter could crash in some cases when an initial empty string was received by a meter using InlineSetting.</li>
<li><b>Fixed</b> Shape meter: Fixed an issue where certain gradients would not display correctly if there were multiple gradients in a shape meter.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li><b>Added</b> InputText plugin: Added InputLimit (default 0) option to limit the number of characters input.</li>
<li><b>Added</b> InputText plugin: Added InputNumber (default 0) option to force numeric-only input.</li>
<li><b>Added</b> Manage: Add a <a href="http://docs.rainmeter.net/manual-beta/user-interface/manage/#CreateNewSkin">Create new skin</a> button to the top of the skins list. This will create a new root-level config / skin using a skin template you can edit. The new skin will be selected in Manage and opened in your text editor.</li>
<li><b>Fixed</b> Shape meter: Corrected an issue where using TransformationMatrix on a Shape meter would cause incorrect mouse detection.</li>
</ul>

<p><b>November 20, 2016 - Revision 2708</b></p>
<ul>
<li><b>Added</b> Shape meter: Added new Path shape to the Shape Meter.See the documentation at: <a href="https://docs.rainmeter.net/manual-beta/meters/shape/">Shape Meter</a>.</li>
<li><b>Changed</b> Shape meter: All measurements in "pixels" in the definition of shapes are now Device Independent Pixels, and may be fractional (i.e 10.25 or 0.75) for precision.</li>
<li><b>Changed</b> Shape meter: Anchor points in the Scale and Skew transform modifiers now default to the center of the shape, rather than the top-left.</li>
</ul>

<p><b>November 13, 2016 - Revision 2690</b></p>
<ul>
<li><b>Added</b> Shape meter: Added new Ellipse, Line, Arc and Curve shapes to the Shape meter. See the documentation at: <a href="https://docs.rainmeter.net/manual-beta/meters/shape/">Shape Meter</a>.</li>

<li><b>Fixed</b> Rainmeter: Corrected an issue parsing options that use the pipe <code>|</code> character as a separator, if they also contained a formula that used the <code>||</code> Logical OR operator.</li>
</ul>

<p><b>November 6, 2016 - Revision 2679</b></p>
<ul>
<li><b>Added</b> Shape meter: Draws shapes using Vector graphics. Rectangle and Combine shapes, as well as all Attribute and Transform modifiers implemented in this first beta. See the documentation at: <a href="https://docs.rainmeter.net/manual-beta/meters/shape/">Shape Meter</a>.</li>
<li><b>Changed</b> String meter: Changed the number of degrees of angle in InlineSetting Gradients to allow fractional numbers. (e.g. 45.5).</li>
<li><b>Fixed</b> About dialog: Corrected an issue where tabs were not being correctly displayed in the Log and Skins panels.</li>
<li><b>Fixed</b> RunCommand plugin: Corrected a rare issue when the command is run by OnCloseAction, where Rainmeter would unexpectedly terminate and the command not execute.</li>

<ul>
<li><b>Fixed</b> Illustro skins: Changed the remote site used to get the user's WAN IP address in the Network.ini skin.</li>
<li><b>Changed</b> Lua scripting: Corrected an issue where anything defined in the Initialize() function of a Lua script was treated as "global" across all skins using Lua, which could cause "bleeding" of defined variables between skins, or between script measures in a single skin. Each Lua measure will now run in an entirely separate local context.</li>
<li><b>Changed</b> Lua scripting: The above change to the context of each Lua measure in a skin has allowed for the use of the Lua <a href="https://docs.rainmeter.net/manual-beta/lua-scripting/#dofile">dofile function</a> in your scripts. Some changes were made to the standard Lua dofile functionality to support Unicode characters in a file path, and to improve error logging.</li>
</ul>

<p>July 13, 2016 - Revision 2618</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Fixed</b> String meter: Corrected an issue where the position of an inline Gradient could be incorrect when an inline Shadow was also used on the meter.</li>
</ul>

<p>July 12, 2016 - Revision 2617</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Added</b> String meter: Added <a href="https://docs.rainmeter.net/manual-beta/meters/string/inline/#InlineShadow">Shadow</a> InlineSetting type to String meter Inline options. This will allow you to add a drop shadow to all or part of a string.</li>

</ul>

<p>March 22, 2016 - Revision 2607</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Fixed</b> Corrected a rare issue where skins might be loaded with only partial opacity when Windows is first started.</li>
<li><b>Changed</b> The Rainmeter notification area icon is forced to be visible any time there are no skins loaded in Rainmeter. This will temporarily override any setting for "Show notification area icon" in Manage. This change is to eliminate the possibility that a user could turn off the tray icon and then unload all skins, thus no longer having any way to interact with Rainmeter.</li>
<li><b>Changed</b> Language: Updates to Russian language.</li>
</ul>

<li><b>Changed</b> Language: Updates to Chinese Traditional language.</li>
</ul>

<p>March 12, 2016 - Revision 2593</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Added</b> SysInfo: Added <a href="https://docs.rainmeter.net/manual-beta/plugins/sysinfo/#Network">DOMAINWORKGROUP</a> SysInfoType value to the SysInfo plugin. This will return either the "domain" or "workgroup" set for the system.</li>
<li><b>Added</b> WebParser: Added <a href="https://docs.rainmeter.net/manual-beta/plugins/webparser/#LogSubstringErrors">LogSubstringErrors</a> parent measure option.</li>

<li><b>Changed</b> InlineSetting: Changed the default value for InlinePattern(<em>N</em>) to <code>.*</code> (the entire string) when the option is left off or set to <code>""</code>. This will allow you to set an InlineSetting on the entire string value without needing to define any matching InlinePattern. Details can be found at <a href="https://forum.rainmeter.net/viewtopic.php?f=116&t=22783">Change Announcements</a>.</li>
<li><b>Fixed</b> GradientColor: Corrected a bug that would not properly adjust a GradientColor InlineSetting when the width or height of the meter was changed but the string value was not.</li>

<p>August 15, 2015 - Revision 2461</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Added</b> Skins: Added new <code>SkinWidth</code> and <code>SkinHeight</code> option to the [Rainmeter] section of a skin. This will constrain the skin to the dimensions defined, either the width, the height, or both. Any meter or part of a meter positioned outside the defined boundaries will be truncated.

<li><b>Changed</b> PCRE library: Updated the PCRE library to version 8.37. Also added the UTF-16 version of the library files, and changed all Rainmeter functionality to use the UTF-16 libraries.</li>
</ul>

<p>August 6, 2015 - Revision 2438</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Changed</b> Skin Installer: The Skin Installer application, used to install .rmskin files in Rainmeter, has been modified so it will by default not replace a newer version of an included 3rd-party plugin with an older version. This is based on the "File version" information in the compiled .dll file(s).</li>
<li><b>Fixed</b> String meter: Corrected an issue with the Inline Options <code>GradientColor</code> setting, that was causing incorrect percentage placement of the gradient in some cases.</li>
<li><b>Fixed</b> Image meter: Corrected an issue where removing a <code>MaskImageName</code> with !SetOption was not possible.</li>
</ul>

<p>July 31, 2015 - Revision 2423</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Added</b> String meter: Added new <a href="/manual-beta/meters/string/inline">Inline Options</a> features to the String meter. This will allow "inline" formatting of part or all of a string, and adds several new formatting options including a color gradient.</li>

<li><b>Fixed</b> Plugin API: Corrected a bug, introduced in r2416, which caused some threaded plugins to fail when sending a FinishAction to Rainmeter.</li>
</ul>

<p>May 31, 2015 - Revision 2416</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Fixed</b> RegExpSubstitute: Corrected a bug, introduced in r2414, where comparisons with an empty string could fail.</li>
<li><b>Fixed</b> Plugin API: Corrected a long-standing issue where a plugin could crash or hang Rainmeter if Refresh All or Unload Skin was done while the plugin was executing commands to the main Rainmeter process.</li>
</ul>

<p>May 24, 2015 - Revision 2414</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Fixed</b> RegExpSubstitute: Fixed a problem where a (capture) that returned an empty string would cause Rainmeter to hang or crash. Care should still be taken when using <code>*</code> (zero or more) quantifiers or <code>(?(?=</code> (If/Then Lookaround) constructs in RegExpSubstitute, as any (capture) returning an empty string will cause the Substitute to fail.</li>
<li><b>Fixed</b> Net measures: Improved the detection of "Best" and "named" <code>Interface</code> options on Windows XP.</li>
</ul>

<p>April 30, 2015 - Revision 2412</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Fixed</b> Net measures: Corrected a bug when using Interface with a number, introduced in r2410. It is important that this new version be used in place of r2410.</li>
</ul>

<p>April 29, 2015 - Revision 2410</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Changed</b> Net measures: Changed the values accepted for the <a href="/manual-beta/measures/net#Interface">Interface</a> option to accept new values of "Best", which will automatically use the active network interface, or a string value of the name of the desired Network Interface Controller (NIC).</li>
<li><b>Changed</b> SysInfo plugin: Changed the values accepted for the <a href="/manual-beta/plugins/sysinfo#SysInfoData">SysInfoData</a> option with network related <a href="/manual-beta/plugins/sysinfo#Network">SysInfoType</a> options to accept new values of "Best", which will automatically use the active network interface, or a string value of the name of the desired Network Interface Controller (NIC).</li>
<li><b>Changed</b> About / Log: Changed the Time column in the About / Log panel to use the current time in Hours, Minutes, Seconds and Milliseconds rather than elapsed time since Rainmeter was started.</li>
</ul>

<p>April 6, 2015 - Revision 2402</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Added</b> Loop: Added new <a href="/manual-beta/measures/loop">Loop</a> measure. This will create a looping counter between two numbers.</li>
<li><b>Added</b> NowPlaying: Added a value of <code>Genre</code> to the <a href="/manual-beta/plugins/nowplaying#PlayerType">PlayerType</a> option. This option value is currently supported with the AIMP, CAD, iTunes, WMP and WinAmp <a href="/manual-beta/plugins/nowplaying#PlayerName">PlayerName</a> values.</li> 
</ul>

<h2 id="3.2">Rainmeter 3.2.1</h2>

<p>March 24, 2015 - Revision 2386</p>
<p><b>3.2.1 Release Version</b></p>
<ul>

<p><b>3.2 Release Version</b></p>
<ul>
<li><b>Fixed</b> QuotePlugin: Changed the routines used to generate a random number to be more reliable.</li>
</ul>

<p>March 15, 2015 - Revision 2383</p>
<p><b>Release Candidate 1</b></p>
<ul>
<li><b>Added</b> WebParser: Added new <a href="/manual-beta/plugins/webparser/#OnDownloadErrorAction">OnDownloadErrorAction</a> to WebParser measures to allow taking an action when a remote file defined by <code>Download=1</code> fails to download or can't be saved locally.</li>
<li><b>Changed</b> Rainmeter: Added the value <code>~100</code> to both Manage and the skin context menus to support setting the transparency of a skin to an opacity of <code>1</code>, which is invisible but will still react to the mouse. This can be used in conjunction with the <a href="/manual-beta/user-interface/manage/#SkinSettings">fade in / fade out / on hover</a> capabilities.</li>
</ul>

<p>March 9, 2015 - Revision 2380</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Fixed</b> AudioLevel: Fixed a long-standing issue where stopping music or other sounds or exiting an application playing music or other sounds could cause the plugin just keep the last values it received. This resulted in a freezing of meter displays and on some systems a buzzing sound being produced for some number of milliseconds.</li>
</ul>

<p>March 3, 2015 - Revision 2379</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Fixed</b> Rainmeter: Fixed a bug introduced in r2378 that would crash Rainmeter if a malformed option, with a trailing comma, i.e. <code>FontColor=255,255,255,</code> was used.</li>
</ul>

<p>March 2, 2015 - Revision 2378</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Added</b> WebParser: Added new <a href="/manual-beta/plugins/webparser/#OnConnectErrorAction">OnConnectErrorAction</a> to WebParser parent measures to allow taking an action when a site or file resource cannot be connected to.</li>
<li><b>Added</b> WebParser: Added new <a href="/manual-beta/plugins/webparser/#OnRegExpErrorAction">OnRegExpErrorAction</a> to WebParser parent measures to allow taking an action when parsing a site or file resource with <code>RegExp</code> (regular expression) fails.</li>
<li><b>Changed</b> WebParser: Changed the <a href="/manual-beta/plugins/webparser/#FinishAction">FinishAction</a> to not be executed when parsing a site or file resource with <code>RegExp</code> (regular expression) fails AND an <code>OnRegExpErrorAction</code> is defined on the measure.</li>
<li><b>Added</b> WebParser: Added a new <a href="/manual-beta/plugins/webparser/#CommandMeasureReset">Reset</a> command, used with the <a href="/manual-beta/bangs/#CommandMeasure">!CommandMeasure</a> bang, to reset all values in the WebParser parent and related child measures to their initial empty values.</li>
<li><b>Fixed</b> Math: Corrected a problem when a comma-separated, multi-argument math function was used in a formula in a comma-separated, multi-argument option. For instance using <code>Clamp(x,low,high)</code> in the arguments for <code>FontColor=rrr,ggg,bbb,aaa</code>.</li>
<li><b>Fixed</b> Skin Installer: Changed the Skin Packager to only allow inclusion of a valid 400x60 .bmp file as a custom header in a .rmskin. Improperly sized custom images were causing visual problems in the Skin Installer user interface.</li>
</ul>

<p>February 22, 2015 - Revision 2373</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Changed</b> Time: Added a <code>Local</code> value to the FormatLocale option, e.g. <code>FormatLocale=Local</code>. This will cause the output format of the measure to automatically use the date / time "locale" language and format set in Windows for the machine the skin is running on, rather than defaulting to a standard platform-agnostic "English" representation.</li>
<li><b>Fixed</b> Time: Accounted for some minor bugs in Microsoft's implementation of the code to read and parse the TimeStampFormat option.</li>
</ul>

<p>February 18, 2015 - Revision 2371</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Changed</b> Time: Changed the <a href="/manual-beta/measures/time#TimeStamp">TimeStamp</a> option to allow a formatted date / time string as input.</li> 
<li><b>Added</b> Time: Added new <a href="/manual-beta/measures/time#TimeStampFormat">TimeStampFormat</a> and <a href="/manual-beta/measures/time#TimeStampLocale">TimeStampLocale</a> options to support the changes to TimeStamp above.</li>
<li><b>Added</b> Time: Added new <a href="/manual-beta/measures/time#FormatLocale">FormatLocale</a> option to support formatting a Time measure in any defined language / locale.</li>
<li><b>Added</b> UpTime: Added a new <a href="/manual-beta/measures/uptime#SecondsValue">SecondsValue</a> option to allow formatting any defined number of seconds into "days, hours, minutes, seconds" as desired. This will override the default behavior of the UpTime measure.</li>
<li><b>Added</b> Section Variables: Added a new <a href="/manual-beta/variables/section-variables#Timestamp">:Timestamp</a> section variable measure modifier. This will return the Windows timestamp value of the named Time measure, and overcomes a limitation with getting and using this number when a Time measure has a Format option.<br/><br/>
All of the above additions and changes are related to new functionality for getting and using date / time information in skins. As well as support for Language / Locale values in Time measures. Details and examples can be found at <a href="//forum.rainmeter.net/viewtopic.php?f=114&t=20398">Change Announcements</a>.</li>
</ul>

<li><b>Added</b> FileView: Added a new <em>PathToFile</em> value for the <a href="/manual-beta/plugins/fileview#Type">Type</a> child measure option. This will return just the path the file, including a trailing "\".</li>
</ul>

<p>January 27, 2015 - Revision 2355</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Fixed</b> Context Menu: Corrected some functionality bugs introduced in r2353 with the display and sorting of items on the context menus.</li>

</ul>

<p>August 21, 2014 - Revision 2308</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Added</b> Image: New Mask Image functionality added. See <a href="/manual-beta/meters/image#MaskImage">Image - Mask Image</a> for documentation, and <a href="//forum.rainmeter.net/viewtopic.php?p=103408#p103408">Change Announcements</a> for more details.</li>

		<ul>
			<li>0: Does nothing. (default)</li>

			<li>2: Decodes only numeric character references.</li>

	<li>Single and double quotes MUST be "mismatched" on the "find:replace" pairs when using single quotes as a delimiter, or the Substitute will fail. Example: Substitute='"':"None" will replace a quote with the word None. Substitute="None":'"' will replace the word None with a quote. However, Substitute='"':'None' will fail, as you can't use single quotes on both sides of the "find:replace" pairs. An easier to read example is Substitute='red':'blue', which will fail.</li>

		<p>Added new !bangs to change "settings" in Rainmeter.ini for current / group / all skins at once.</p>
		<ul>
			<li>!RainmeterDraggable/!RainmeterDraggableGroup</li>
			<li>!RainmeterKeepOnScreen/!RainmeterKeepOnScreenGroup</li>
			<li>!RainmeterClickThrough/!RainmeterClickThroughGroup</li>
			<li>!RainmeterSnapEdges/!RainmeterSnapEdgesGroup</li>
			<li>!RainmeterSnapEdges [parm1] (Config | *)</li>
			<li>!RainmeterSnapEdgesGroup [parm1] [GroupName]</li>
		</ul>

		<p>Parm1:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>-1 toggles the setting.</li>
			<li>0 forces the setting to off.</li>
			<li>1 forces to setting to on.</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>WebParser: Fix for issue where StringIndexes from previous call to WebParser would remain even if the item no longer exists. This fixes a long standing problem with uTorrent skins for example, when the last item was removed from uTorrent but remained displayed in the skin until a refresh was done.</li>
	<li>Added MeasureName2 as an alternative to SecondaryMeasureName in Meter=Histogram.</li>
	<li>Changes to CALC measure to remove any and all restrictions on the string case of function names. Calc measures are now completely case-insensitive, with the exception of the "b/o/x" character when specifying the base of a number, this must be lower case.</li>
	<li>Added new PluginMediaKey plugin by poiru.</li>
	<li>Some minor improvements to MouseOver/MouseLeave actions.</li>
	<li>Change to Rainstaller to close RainBrowser if it is running when a skin is installed, to eliminate a problem with open files.</li>
	<li>Fix by elestel to iTunes plugin: iTunesPlugin did not handle AboutToPromptUserToQuitEvent.</li>
	<li>Added new #ROOTCONFIGPATH# variable. This will contain the path to the highest level folder under \Skins for the current config. #ROOTCONFIGPATH#Settings\UserVariables.inc can be used to have an @Include work even if you move a skin to another "suite" for instance.</li>
	<li>Re-design of the layout of the Rainmeter manual. The manual is now exclusively online. The "Help" context menu item will launch the appropriate (release or beta) version of the manual in your default web browser. The Rainmeter.chm help file is no longer included in the build or installed on your PC.</li>
	<li>Added new !RainmeterWriteKeyValue bang. !RainmeterWriteKeyValue "Section" "Key" "Value" ("FileSpec"), where "FileSpec" is an optional parameter. If FileSpec is not present, the change is automatically done in the currently running skin file. If the bang is executed from the command line, FileSpec is required. FileSpec must be either in the \Skins or %APPDATA%\Rainmeter paths. This can be used to permanently change any Key=Value setting in any .ini or .inc file (Including Rainmeter.ini).</li>
	<li>Changes to MouseLeaveAction to make it more reliable and faster. This should eliminate having to put MouseLeaveAction in the [Rainmeter] section to ensure detection.</li>
	<li>Made the "About" dialog a bit larger by default. Other cosmetic changes to this dialog.</li>
	<li>Fixed WifiStatusPlugin so it no longer closes WLAN handle when skin is closed even if another skin is still using it.</li>
	<li>Fixed an issue where an invalid Format= code in a Time or Uptime measure would crash Rainmeter. Invalid formats are now written to the debug log and the measure just gracefully fails.</li>
	<li>Change to Rainstaller so that a default Rainmeter plugin will not be overwritten if an author includes it by mistake in a .rmskin file.</li>
	<li>Fixed an issue where Rainmeter was detecting an incorrect value for %APPDATA% in a multi-user environment.</li>
	<li>Fixed an issue where check marks of context menu items in configs/root/variants menu are cleared if !RainmeterDeactivateConfig/!RainmeterToggleConfig is used.</li>
	<li>Minor fix to new "groups" function for configs.</li>
	<li>Added root folder of a config on the skin context menu.</li>
	<li>Fixed an issue where the context menu did not close when focus was given to another windows element.</li>
	<li>Many additions to the supported Windows Messages that Rainmeter will respond to, allowing 3rd-party applications to query Rainmeter for paths, currently loaded configs, etc. These changes are courtesy of JamesAC and Patrick from Dexpot.</li>
	<li>Added the Win7AudioPlugin plugin by Reiswaffle.</li>
	<li>Added the PluginVirtualDesktops plugin from Patrick at Dexpot. This will provide support for Virtual Desktop Management tools like Dexpot and VirtuaWin.</li>
	<li>Added new "version checking" functionality, with DisableVersionChecking= setting in Rainmeter.ini and on "About" dialog.</li>
	<li>Re-design of the RainBrowser GUI.</li>
	<li>Major re-design of the Rainmeter and Skins context menus.</li>
	<li>Fix to Calc measure to properly allow use of numbering systems other than decimal using a prefix of 0b (binary) 0x (hex) 0o (octal) on the numbers.</li>
	<li>Added "Group=" to meters and measures in skins, and in Rainmeter.ini to support configs. This allows many !bangs to operate on multiple entities at once without multiple !bang statements.</li>
	<li>Major improvement to "logging" in Rainmeter, including new context menu support.</li>
	<li>Addition of support for multiple monitors when using DesktopWorkArea. This change is courtesy of user Jott.</li>
	<li>Addtion of "ToolTip" functionality, so meters can have standard Windows tooltips when hovered over.</li>
	<li>Improvement to image quality when scaling images.</li>

<h2 id="1.2">Rainmeter 1.2</h2>
<h3 id="r440">24 June, 2010 <small>(r440)</small></h3>
<ul>
	<li>Major improvements to how Rainmeter works with multiple monitors.</li>
	<li>New WebParser settting "DownloadFile=" to allow local storage and naming of downloaded images.</li>
	<li>New !Bang - !RainmeterRefreshApp. Allows full Rainmeter refresh from a skin or command line.</li>
	<li>FIXED: Issue where DynamicVariables=1 disabled UpdateDivider.</li>
	<li>FIXED: LineColor did not use the values of Dynamic Variables in Meter=Line.</li>
	<li>FIXED: Inconsistent numerical value via DynamicVariables. ( issue 130 )</li>
	<li>FIXED: Problem with WebParser and "local files" with Cyrillic chars in the path. (issue 139)</li>
	<li>The coded character set of the logfile is changed to UTF-8. (ccs=UTF-8) <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/yeby3zcb(VS.80).aspx">msdn.microsoft.com</a></li>
	<li>"MS Shell Dlg 2" is now used for the ABOUT dialog box. <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/282187">msdn.microsoft.com</a></li>

	<li>Added Rainmeter version information to the right click (Properties / Details) menu for Rainmeter.exe.</li>
	<li>Fixed an issue with Rainmeter properly using UNC (Universal Naming Convention) network shared drives / folders, such as "\\SERVER".</li>
	<li>Fixed a small bug in @Include routines that impacted some @Inlcude and MeterStyle combinations.</li>
	<li>The RANDOM math function was case sensitive, requiring "Random" only. Now case insensitive.</li>
	<li>Fixed an issue where a very high Update rate could cause problems closing a skin.</li>
	<li>Changed the HighBound parameter for RANDOM to return up to and including the number in HighBound instead of just up to.</li>
	<li>Added #CRLF# as a built-in variable to allow putting a carriage return / line feed in a string meter.</li>
	<li>Changed the undocumented LG (logarithm) function to be LOG and added to the manual.</li>
